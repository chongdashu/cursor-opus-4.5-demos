### 🧱 [Image Brick Voxelizer](./image-brick-voxelizer)

Transform any image into an interactive 3D brick art creation with explosive physics—inspired by those iconic building blocks we all know and love.

**Features:**
- Image-to-voxel conversion with intelligent color matching
- Full 3D navigation (rotate, pan, zoom)
- Satisfying explosion animation (press spacebar!)
- Smooth reassembly effect
- Beautiful frosted-glass UI with dark theme
- Built with Three.js for silky 60fps performance

Upload a photo, watch it become pixelated brick art, then blow it up. Because why not?
