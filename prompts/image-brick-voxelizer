Build me an app where I can upload an image, and it will create a voxelized version of the image as if it's made up of LEGO bricks. Obviously, of the same size. What I want is that I should be able to pan around in 3D space, and if I press the space bar, it should explode the pieces into their individual pieces with a nice visual effect. Ensure that the web page looks visually pleasing and appealing, and ensure that it's clear how to interact with the system.
